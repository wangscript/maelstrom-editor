## Maelstrom tools ##
The goal of maelstrom is to provide a set of tools for creating games utilizing the vortex engine (http://code.google.com/p/vortex-engine). Below are different utilities currently in the toolset.

### The Maelstrom editor ###
Located in trunk/maelstrom-engine/ is written in C++ with Qt. Should provide a way to design levels and manage content, running on an actual instance of the vortex engine to provide direct feedback on how the game will look and feel.

### vacp, the Vortex Asset Conditioning Pipeline ###
located in trunk/vacp/ and is written in C++ with Qt. Implements a custom build system to automate the build-process of content.
